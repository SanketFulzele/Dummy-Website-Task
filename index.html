          Mesozoic Era of the geological time scale is often known as the Age of Reptiles. During this period, there
          were many reptilian species living on this planet in abundance. Among these reptilian species was the group of
          Dinosaurs. A group or clade (Dinosauria) of dinosaur involves different species of dinosaur.

          It is clear that dinosaurs lived on the Earth 247 – 241 million years ago and they lived for more than 175
          million years on this planet. Out of these 175 million years, dinosaurs were living as the dominant species
          for almost 135 million years.

          After a certain period of time, that is in the Cretaceous Period of the Mesozoic Era, these dinosaurs became
          extinct. The reason behind this is still not known due to inadequate evidence present to support the
          respective theories.
          There were also some dinosaurs who walked on 2 legs whereas some dinosaurs walked on 4 legs and there were
          some dinosaurs which could walk on 2 legs as well as 4 legs.

          They also had varying shape of the body, for example, some had horns, crests, bony armor, differences in the
          shape of the hip (reptile-hipped known as Saurischia and bird-hipped known as Ornithischia), etc.

          All these factors were varying in different dinosaurs thus, making it a very diverse group of reptiles with
          similar taxonomic characteristics. The knowledge of dinosaurs is all learnt from the available fossil records.
          Dinosaurs have various characteristic features but certain features are similar, for example, all dinosaurs
          are oviparous in nature that is, dinosaurs lay eggs and these eggs then hatch into young ones of the
          dinosaurs, dinosaurs are uricotelic (they excrete uric acid), etc.

          During the Jurassic Period that is 200 – 145 million years ago, the dinosaurs were the dominant species on the
          earth which lead to excessive population of dinosaur species.

          And after the Jurassic Period, when the Cretaceous Period began, the dinosaurs became extinct. There are
          various theories which have suggested the process of extinction of dinosaurs.

          During the cretaceous period, there was a mass extinction event which caused the extinction of various species
          along with the dinosaurs. For example, planktons, brachiopods, etc. they also disappeared along with the
          non-avian dinosaurs but the fact about dinosaurs declining before the mass extinction event still remains a
          mystery.

            A shark has multiple rows of teeth. The mouth of sharks is in the front of the head. In some species, sharks
            Sharks have a very different breathing system than most animals that live in or on this earth. Sharks also
            receive oxygen from the water through gills, yet, unlike fish, sharksDinosaur Dinosaurs: Extinct or Natural
            Causes As geologic time goes, all the dinosaurs living on earth suddenly disappeared. How did these
            dominated and gigantic creatures really die? Was it a slow extinction through natural causes, or did it
            happen suddenly? These questions give rise to many different beliefs on how the dinosaurs disappeared over
            sixty-five million years ago. Something happened sixty-five million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous
            period that was so devastating  During the mass extinction event, it is believed that there was a rise in the Earth’s or global temperature.
            There are different theories which explain about the rise of the temperature on the Earth and therefore, why
            or how the dinosaurs got extinct due to the impact.
  
            The first theory is that of an asteroid hitting the Earth which suggests that there were basalt eruptions and
            decrease in the sea level which led to increase in temperature along with a comet striking the seabed near the
            Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico which led to the mass extinction event.
  
            The second theory was of the Volcanic eruption which led to drastic changes in the global temperature thus,
            blocking the sunlight with debris that disrupted all the photosynthetic systems as well as the food chain.
  
            Now, the scientist came to a conclusion with these two theories was because of the rock which was discovered
            and was dated back to the extinction event. This rock was rich in Iridium metal which is not that abundant on
            the earth’s surface but is either found in the asteroid masses or in the volcanic lava.
  
            Therefore, this discovery made the scientists to believe that the mass extinction event was most likely
            triggered due to a huge volcano or some asteroid.
  
            Nevertheless, there are many such facts which are still unexplained and therefore, the sudden disappearance of
            the dinosaurs from the Earth is also a mystery.

        Balaenoptera Musculus, or the blue whale, is the largest mammal in the world. This enormous mammal can grow to
        be 110 feet long and weigh as much as 190 tons. That's longer than two city buses and the total weight of 30
        elephants. This giant is powered by a heart the size of a taxi-cab. The blue whale's of the Antarctic grow
        larger than those of the Northern Hemisphere. Also, the females tend to be slightly larger than the males of the
        same age. These mammals are bluish-gray in color, with some paler spots. <br><br>
        Algae tends to accumulate on their
        bellies causing a yellowish or mustard color. It has a mottled appearance with a broad, flattened U-shaped head.
        Fifty to ninety throat grooves run from the mouth to the belly. Instead of teeth, blue whales have 270 to 400
        black baleen plates on each side of their mouths. These plates are about forty inches long and twenty-two inches
        wide. The blue whale has a tiny, stubby dorsal fin set far back on its body. It has a 20 foot wide, slightly
        notched, triangular flukes, which is propelled by an extremely thick tail stock. The flippers on this creature
        are long and slender, and are about one-seventh of the whale's body length. <br><br>
        The blue whale's most prominent
        feature is its exceptionally fleshy splashgaurd, which surrounds the blowholes at the front and sides. This
        whale spouts a single slender jet that soars forty to fifty feet high.
        The blue whale has very poor eyesight, no sense of smell, and has no sense of taste. However, the blue whale
        does have well-developed senses of touch and hearing. This large mammal has a life span of about eighty years.
        At this time there is not too much known about the blue whale's behavior. Blowing and diving patterns vary
        according to the whale's activity. <br><br>
        The blue whale blows every ten to twenty seconds for a total of two to six minutes, when relaxed, and then
        dives. They usually stay submerged for five to twenty minutes, but can stay
        under for up to 40 minutes. Blue whale's usually dive to around 490 feet, but can go deeper if need be. When
        swimming slowly, the whale rises at a shallow angle. He blows as soon as the head begins to brake the surface.
        The head disappears below the surface and a long expanse of the back rolls into view.
